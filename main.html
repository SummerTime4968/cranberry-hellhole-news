        <h1 style="font-family:helvetica"> NSFW Channel has been created!</h1>

        <p style="font-family:helvetica"> On Sunday, January 28th at 11:36 AM. Cran has announced that there will now be a seperate channel from general
        that will be used for all things related to NSFW. This annoucement has lit up a small disscussion by the folks in the server about said NSFW channel.
        Cran allegedly stated that the NSFW channel was created because they were tired of seeing things related to NSFW in #general and that some people could
        be uncomfortable with it. A rule has also been created stating that all NSFW related things should go into the NSFW channel instead of any other channel
        in addition of two new roles on whether or not you can access the NSFW channel or not. However, the rule also means the "tally hall mpreg" won’t be in 
        #general anymore becuse of the existence of the new channel and rule, which caused a small excitement amongst the server members.</p>

        <p style="font-family:helvetica"> In other news, Li reported having her heart "lurch" after Summer posted an .gif file in #general that showed a
        prehistoric humanoid skeleton thinking.</p>
